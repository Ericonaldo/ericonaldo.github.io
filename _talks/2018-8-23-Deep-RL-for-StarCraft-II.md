An introduction of our work in Deecamp2018 which achieved StarCraft AI with Deep Reinforcement Learning. <br>

In this work we first use reward shaping for StarCraft Minigame-CollectMineralShards and we gain higher scores than previous benchmark.[[Demo-Video]](/files/SC_AI_for_Minigame-BuildMarines.mp4)[[Code]](https://github.com/Ericonaldo/pysc2_minimap_agents)

Then we use hierarchical learning for StarCraft Minigame--BuildMarines and we gain higher scores than previous benchmark.[[Demo-Video]](/files/SC_AI_for_Minigame-BuildMarines.mp4)[[Code]] <br>
