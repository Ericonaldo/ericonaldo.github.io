To be precisely, the "imitation learning" is the general problem of learning from expert demonstration (LfD). There are 2 names derived from such a description, which are Imitation Learning and Apprenticeship Learning due to historical reason. Usually, apprenticeship learning is mentioned in the context of "Apprentiship learning via inverse reinforcement learning (IRL)" which recovers the reward function and learn policies from it, while imitation learing began with behavior cloning that learn the policy directly ([ref](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/56577/apprenticeship-vs-imitation-learning-what-is-the-difference)). However, with the develepment of related researches, "imitation learning" is always used to represent the general LfD problem setting, which is also our view of point.
