* I received my Bachelor’s Degree at [Southwest Jiao Tong University](http://www.swjtu.edu.cn/) at June 2019. I am now pursuing my Ph.D degree in [Apex Lab.](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) supervised by [Prof. Weinan Zhang](http://wnzhang.net/) and [Prof. Yong Yu](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/members/yyu). [[Curriculum Vitae]](/files/minghuanliu_cv.pdf)(update in July. 2019)

* I love playing football and I am a fan of [Shandong Luneng Taishan](http://www.lnts.com.cn/), I want to make things on football with AI. Clip [[demo-1]](/files/sac-demo1.mov) and [[demo-2]](/files/sac-demo2.mov) to see some interesting gadgets I've made for football during the Sports Analytics Challenge sponsored by PSG.

* My current research interests lie in the general area of reinforcement learning, particularly in multi-agent systems.
