    Tuchel and Me!

* I received my Bachelor’s Degree at [Southwest Jiao Tong University](http://www.swjtu.edu.cn/) at June 2019. I am now pursuing my Ph.D. degree in [Apex Lab.](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) supervised by [Prof. Weinan Zhang](http://wnzhang.net/) and [Prof. Yong Yu](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/members/yyu). Currently I am the group leader of [ApexRL](https://github.com/apexrl), the RL research group of Apex Lab. I am also a member of [Wu Wen Jun Honorary Doctoral Plan (吴文俊荣誉博士班)](https://xsb.seiee.sjtu.edu.cn/xsb/info/33498.htm), advised by [Prof. Cewu Lu](https://www.mvig.org/). I won [ByteDance Scholars Program (字节跳动奖学金)](https://ur.bytedance.com/scholarship) (10 candidates worldwide each year) in 2022. [[My Curriculum Vitae]](/files/minghuanliu_cv.pdf) (update in Sept. 2022)

* My current research interests lie in the general area of reinforcement learning, including imitation learning, offline RL and RL in multi-agent systems. Particularly, I was devoted in utilizing (data-driven) RL methods towards solving real-world decision-making challenges. When I read interesting papers I will write down notes in Chinese at [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/eric-liu-57-75/posts), where I have more than 4.4k followers.

* Football (soccer), Forward, A fan of [Shandong Luneng Taishan](http://www.lnts.com.cn/), A beginner of football analystics with AI. 
    * Click [[demo-1]](/files/sac-demo1.mp4) and [[demo-2]](/files/sac-demo2.mp4) to see some interesting gadgets I've made for football analysis during the Sports Analytics Challenge sponsored by PSG. 
    <!-- * Click [[doc-1]](/files/mot_project.pdf) to see a small project that I've made with my classmates about Multi-Object Tracking for basketball players on NCAA video dataset. -->
    * Have kept a document called [Football-Analytics-101](https://football-analytics-101.readthedocs.io) on football analytics motivated by [NBAStuffer-Analytics-101](https://www.nbastuffer.com/analytics-101/), in order to provide ordered, collected and detailed, information about football (soccer) analytics for research works and interesting stuff. <!-- I will be geard towards collecting such information and try to find interesting topics to do as a research hobby.-->
