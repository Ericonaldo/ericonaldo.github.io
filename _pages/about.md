    Tuchel and Me!

<!-- * I received my Bachelor’s Degree at [Southwest Jiao Tong University](http://www.swjtu.edu.cn/) at June 2019. I am now pursuing my Ph.D. degree in [Apex Lab.](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) supervised by [Prof. Weinan Zhang](http://wnzhang.net/) and [Prof. Yong Yu](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/members/yyu). I used to be the group leader of [ApexRL](https://github.com/apexrl), the RL research group of Apex Lab. I am also a member of [Wu Wen Jun Honorary Doctoral Plan (吴文俊荣誉博士班)](https://xsb.seiee.sjtu.edu.cn/xsb/info/33498.htm), advised by [Prof. Cewu Lu](https://www.mvig.org/). I won [ByteDance Scholars Program (字节跳动奖学金)](https://ur.bytedance.com/scholarship) (10 candidates worldwide each year) in 2022. [[My Curriculum Vitae]](/files/minghuanliu_cv.pdf) (update in Jan. 2023) -->
* I am currently visiting Prof. [Xiaolong Wang](https://xiaolonw.github.io/)'s Lab, UC San Diego, CA, USA, doing robotics learning research. 

* I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in [Apex Lab.](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Weinan Zhang](http://wnzhang.net/) and [Prof. Yong Yu](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/members/yyu).

[[My Curriculum Vitae]](/files/minghuanliu_cv.pdf) (updated in Feb. 2024)

* My current research interests lie in the general area of **reinforcement learning (RL)**. Particularly, I was devoted in (data-driven) RL methods, like **imitation learning**, **offline RL** that can solve real-world decision-making challenges. 
  
* Recently, I have been taking my knowledge in IL/RL to work on **robotics learning**, aiming at taking intelligent robots closer to real life, e.g., expanding the skills of robots, and helping robots make smart decisions.
  
* When I read interesting papers I will write down notes in Chinese at [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/eric-liu-57-75/posts), where I have **4.6k+** followers.
